                        revised Privacy Policy is posted.</p>

                    <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party online/mobile store from which you install

                        party.</p>

                    <h2>COLLECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
                    We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via
                    AuraMaze depends on the content and materials you use and includes:

                    <h3>Personal Data</h3>
                    Demographic and other personally identifiable information (such as your name and email address) that
                    you voluntarily give to us when choosing to participate in various activities related to AuraMaze,
                    such as posting messages in review sections, liking posts, sending feedback, and responding to
                    surveys. If you choose to share data about yourself via your profile, online chat, or other
                    interactive areas of AuraMaze, please be advised that all data you disclose in these areas is public
                    and your data will be accessible to anyone who accesses AuraMaze.

                    <h3>Derivative Data</h3>
                    Information our servers automatically collect when you access AuraMaze, such as your native actions
                    that are integral to AuraMaze, including liking, re-blogging, or replying to a post, as well as
                    other interactions with AuraMaze and other users via server log files.

                    <h3>Financial Data</h3>
                    Financial information, such as data related to your payment method (e.g. valid credit card number,
                    card brand, expiration date) that we may collect when you purchase, order, return, exchange, or
                    request information about our services from AuraMaze. We store only very limited, if any, financial
                    information that we collect. Otherwise, all financial information is stored by our payment
                    processor, [Payment Processor Name], and you are encouraged to review their privacy policy and

                    you choose to make public. We may also request access to other permissions related to your account,
                    such as friends, check-ins, and likes, and you may choose to grant or deny us access to each
                    individual permission. For more information regarding Facebook permissions, refer to the Facebook

                    address, profile picture, and public data for contacts, if you connect your account to such social

                    opt-out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your device’s
                    settings.

                    <h3>Third-Party Data</h3>
                    Information from third parties, such as personal information or network friends, if you connect your
                    account to the third party and grant AuraMaze permission to access this information.

                    <h3>Data From Contests, Giveaways, and Surveys</h3>

                    <h2>DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
                    We may share information we have collected about you in certain situations. Your information may be
                    disclosed as follows:

                    <h3>By Law or to Protect Rights</h3>
                    If we believe the release of information about you is necessary to respond to legal process, to
                    investigate or remedy potential violations of our policies, or to protect the rights, property, and
                    safety of others, we may share your information as permitted or required by any applicable law,
                    rule, or regulation. This includes exchanging information with other entities for fraud protection
                    and credit risk reduction.

                    <h3>Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
                    We may share your information with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf,
                    including payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and
                    marketing assistance.

                    <h3>Interactions with Other Users</h3>
                    If you interact with other users of AuraMaze, those users may see your name, profile photo, and
                    descriptions of your activity, including sending invitations to other users, chatting with other
                    users, liking posts, following blogs.

                    <h3>Online Postings</h3>
                    When you post comments, contributions or other content to AuraMazes, your posts may be viewed by all
                    users and may be publicly distributed outside AuraMaze in perpetuity.

                    <h3>Offer Wall</h3>
                    The Application may display a third-party-hosted “offer wall.” Such an offer wall allows third-party
                    advertisers to offer virtual currency, gifts, or other items to users in return for acceptance and
                    completion of an advertisement offer. Such an offer wall may appear in AuraMaze and be displayed to
                    you based on certain data, such as your geographic area or demographic information. When you click
                    on an offer wall, you will leave AuraMaze. A unique identifier, such as your user ID, will be shared
                    with the offer wall provider in order to prevent fraud and properly credit your account.

                    <h3>Social Media Contacts</h3>
                    If you connect to AuraMaze through a social network, your contacts on the social network will see
                    your name, profile photo, and descriptions of your activity.

                    <h3>Other Third Parties</h3>
                    We may share your information with advertisers and investors for the purpose of conducting general
                    business analysis. We may also share your information with such third parties for marketing
                    purposes, as permitted by law.

                    <h3>Sale or Bankruptcy</h3>
                    If we reorganize or sell all or a portion of our assets, undergo a merger, or are acquired by
                    another entity, we may transfer your information to the successor entity. If we go out of business
                    or enter bankruptcy, your information would be an asset transferred or acquired by a third party.
                    You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that the transferee may decline honor commitments
                    we made in this Privacy Policy.

                    We are not responsible for the actions of third parties with whom you share personal or sensitive
                    data, and we have no authority to manage or control third-party solicitations. If you no longer wish
                    to receive correspondence, emails or other communications from third parties, you are responsible
                    for contacting the third party directly.

                    <h2>COOKIES</h2>
                    We may use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other tracking technologies on AuraMaze to
                    help customize AuraMaze and improve your experience. When you access AuraMaze, your personal
                    information is not collected through the use of tracking technology. Most browsers are set to accept
                    cookies by default. You can remove or reject cookies, but be aware that such action could affect the
                    availability and functionality of AuraMaze. You may not decline web beacons. However, they can be
                    rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or by modifying your web browser’s settings to notify
                    you each time a cookie is tendered, permitting you to accept or decline cookies on an individual
                    basis.

                    You should be aware that getting a new computer, installing a new browser, upgrading an existing
                    browser, or erasing or otherwise altering your browser’s cookies files may also clear certain
                    opt-out cookies, plug-ins, or settings.

                    <h2>THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES</h2>
                    The Application may contain links to third-party websites and applications of interest, including
                    advertisements and external services, that are not affiliated with us. Once you have used these
                    links to leave AuraMaze, any information you provide to these third parties is not covered by this
                    Privacy Policy, and we cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of your information. Before visiting
                    and providing any information to any third-party websites, you should inform yourself of the privacy
                    policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take
                    those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect the privacy of your information. We are not
                    responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties,
                    including other sites, services or applications that may be linked to or from AuraMaze.

                    <h2>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
                    We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal
                    information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to
                    us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and
                    no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.
                    Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to interception and misuse by unauthorized parties.
                    Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide personal information.

                    <h2>POLICY FOR CHILDREN</h2>
                    We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you
                    become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the
                    contact information provided below.

                    <h2>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or
                    setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
                    browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and
                    implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
                    signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
                    If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you
                    about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.

                    <h2>OPTIONS REGARDING YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
                    <h3>Account Information</h3>

                    and/or comply with legal requirements.
