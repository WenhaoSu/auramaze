Socrates uses his death as a final lesson for his pupils rather than fleeing when the opportunity arises, and faces it calmly.&#91;1&#93; The Phaedo depicts the death of Socrates and is also Plato\\'s fourth and last dialogue to detail the philosopher\\'s final days, which is also detailed in Euthyphro, Apology, and Crito.\\n",
